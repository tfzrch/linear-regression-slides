### Linear Regression: How it works, in 30 minutes

This slide deck covers the fundamentals of linear regression from an 
'application'/'purpose' perspective. It's not intended to be a resource on
how to build a model with code. Instead it focusses on the underlying statistical
principles and how they relate to using linear regression in the real world.

The intended audience is Level 4.

I wrote this deck for an interview for an apprenticeships-based instructor role,
so the materials include a very basic lesson plan oriented around the Level 4 
Data Analyst apprenticeship standards.
