Linear Regression: How it works, in 30 minutes
================
2022-06-27

This slide deck covers the fundamentals of linear regression from an
application/purpose perspective.

It’s not intended to be a resource on how to build a model with code.

Focus is on the underlying ML principles and how they relate to using
linear regression in the real world.

Below is a basic lesson plan oriented around the [Level 4 Data
Analyst](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/data-analyst/)
apprenticeship standards.

## Lesson Plan

**Intended Audience:** Level 4.

**Assumptions:**

-   No prior knowledge of linear regression is assumed
-   Familiarity with the benefit of problem solving with machine
    learning may already be known, but is not assumed
-   Familiarity with scatter plots, and the concept of correlation is
    assumed

### Data Analyst Level 4 Standards (v1.1)

Core standards supported by learning in this session:

| Group     | AM1 (Work Based Project)                            | AM2 (Portfolio)                                                        |
|:----------|:----------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Knowledge | \-                                                  | K14: principles of descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics |
| Skills    | S2: implement stages of the data analysis lifecycle | S11: apply predictive analytics in the use of data                     |

Note that this list is not exhaustive, other standards will be addressed
by applying linear regression in real-world contexts (e.g. standards on
data acquisition, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization
etc).

### Approximate Timing

-   **5mins**:
    -   intro; scope and purpose
    -   **ask for learner input**: machine learning (purpose and
        approach) knowledge.
    -   Illustrate machine learning concept with ingredients/cookies
        analogy if needed
-   **5-15mins**: ingredients/calories business scenario
    -   highlight this is a regression problem because it involves
        continuous data types
    -   scatter plot, correlation
    -   add a linear model
    -   intercept / gradient
    -   combine together
-   **5-10mins**: (possibly a stretch topic)
    -   **ask for learner input**: what makes a model good? how can we
        quantify success?
    -   variance explained
    -   residuals
